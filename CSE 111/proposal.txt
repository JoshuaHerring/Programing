Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
driver evaluation

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
at my work we have a problem with employes that slack off and it is not very well kept track of.
I intend to write a program that will allow us to keep track of our problematic drives and their problems.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
This will help me apply what I have leanred in programming in the real world and will
furhtur my understanidng of dictionaries and how they work and how to modify them effeciently.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
I will almost certainly use csv,datetime, and pytest, module for this assignment.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Yes my rough idea is to have a function for adding in new drives, another to remove drives,
one to add a complaint or error of a driver with the date of error. There will probalbly be more but this is my rough idea.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
yes I will write test functions to make sure my code works properly.
