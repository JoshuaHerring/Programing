Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

During my time in this class I have thoughg a lot about programming and where it is going to be in the future.
With the metaverse and it's inevitable approach I think that programming will be unbelievably powerful for good or for bad
for hobby or for work. It will be everywhere.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
test functions are incredibly important. I think with smaller functions it is hard for me to rationalize making a test function
for them but it is still important and should be done.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

my first step is too look at it manually and try and figure it out. Then I will google the problem that I am having
and if after that I still can not figure it out I take a break. Sometimes after an hour the answer will just pop into my
head and it is as easy and simple as that. Other times I have to come back and look at my code for a while.
So far I have not met a problem that I can not overcome with that tactic.
